## Description

This is a minimalistic and extensible [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) template that incorporates factory pattern architecture with [divisional folder structure](https://exploreflask.com/en/latest/blueprints.html#divisional). It's suitable for developing small to medium sized API oriented micro-services. The architecture is similar to what you'd get with Flask's [Blueprint](https://exploreflask.com/en/latest/blueprints.html).

## Features

* It uses [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework for API development. FastAPI is a modern, highly performant, web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+.

* The APIs are served with [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) server. Uvicorn is a lightning-fast "ASGI" server. It runs asynchronous Python web code in a single process.

* OAuth2 (with hashed password and Bearer with JWT) based authentication

* [CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cors/) enabled.

* Flask inspired divisional folder structure better decoupling and encapsulation. This is suitable for small to medium backend development.

* Dockerized using [python:3.9-slim-bullseye](https://github.com/docker-library/python/blob/bb68424de76756a2d3dc817f87b1f8640112461f/3.8/bullseye/Dockerfile) and optimized for size and functionality.

## Quickstart

### Spin Up the Cookiecutter

* Install [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/installation.html).

* Go to your project folder and run:

    ```bash
    cookiecutter https://github.com/rednafi/fastapi-nano.git
    ```

* Follow the prompts to generate your project.

    ```
    repo [fastapi-nano]:
    api_a [api_a]:
    api_b [api_b]:
    year [2020]:
    fname [Redowan Delowar]:
    email [redowan.nafi@gmail.com]:
    ```

### Run the Containers

* Go to your template folder and run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

### Check the APIs

* To play around with the APIs, go to the following link on your browser:

    ```
    http://localhost:5000/docs
    ```

    This will take you to an UI like below:

* Press the `authorize` button on the right and add *username* and *password*. The APIs use OAuth2 (with hashed password and Bearer with JWT) based authentication. In this case, the username and password is `ubuntu` and `debian` respectively.

    Clicking the `authorize` button will bring up a screen like this:

    ![Screenshot from 2020-06-21 22-18-59](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30027932/85229729-6036cc80-b40d-11ea-877e-7421b927a849.png)



* Then select any of the `api_a` or `api_b` APIs and put an integer in the number box and click the `authorize` button.

* Hitting the API should give a json response with random integers.

    ![Screenshot from 2020-06-21 22-32-28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30027932/85230016-25359880-b40f-11ea-9196-c46fd72a760c.png)


* Also, notice the `curl` section in the above screen shot. You can directly use the highlighted curl command in your terminal.

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api_a/22" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1YnVudHUiLCJleHAiOjY4NDg3NDI1MDl9.varo-uXei0kmGkejkfzCtOkWvW6y7ewzaKBj4qZZHWQ"
    ```

    This should show a response like this:

    ```json
    {
    "seed": 22,
    "random_first": 5,
    "random_second": 13
    }
    ```

* To test the `GET` APIs with Python, you can use a http client library like [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/):

    ```python
    import httpx

    token = (
        "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9."
        + "eyJzdWIiOiJ1YnVudHUiLCJleHAiOjY4NDg3NDI1MDl9."
        + "varo-uXei0kmGkejkfzCtOkWvW6y7ewzaKBj4qZZHWQ"
    )

    headers = {
        "accept": "application/json",
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {token}",
    }

    with httpx.Client() as client:
        response = client.get("http://localhost:5000/api_a/22", headers=headers)
        print(response.json())
    ```

```

In the above structure, `api_a` and `api_b` are the main packages where the code of the APIs live and they are exposed by the endpoints defined in the `routes` folder. Here, `api_a` and `api_b` have identical logic. Basically these are dummy APIs that take an integer as input and return two random integers between zero and the input value. The purpose of including two identical APIs in the template is to demonstrate how you can decouple the logics of multiple APIs and then assemble their endpoints in the routes directory. The following snippets show the logic behind the dummy APIs.

This is a dummy submodule that houses a function called `random_gen` which basically generates a dict of random integers.

```python
# This a dummy module
# This gets called in the module_main.py file
from __future__ import annotations
import random


def rand_gen(num: int) -> dict[str, int]:
    num = int(num)
    d = {
        "seed": num,
        "random_first": random.randint(0, num),
        "random_second": random.randint(0, num),
    }
    return d
```

The `main_func` in the primary module calls the `rand_gen` function from the submodule.

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from app.api_a.submod import rand_gen


def main_func(num: int) -> dict[str, int]:
    d = rand_gen(num)
    return d
```

The endpoint is exposed like this:

```python
# app/routes/views.py
from __future__ import annotations
#... codes regarding authentication ...

# endpoint for api_a (api_b looks identical)
@router.get("/api_a/{num}", tags=["api_a"])
async def view_a(num: int, auth: Depends =Depends(get_current_user)) -> dict[str, int]:
    return main_func_a(num)
```

So hitting the API with a random integer will give you a response like the following:

```json
{
  "seed": 22,
  "random_first": 27,
  "random_second": 20
}
```

## Further Modifications

* You can put your own API logics in the shape of `api_a` and `api_b` packages. You'll have to add additional directories like `api_a` and `api_b` if you need more APIs.

* Then expose the APIs in the `routes/views.py` file. You may choose to create multiple `views` files to organize your endpoints.

* This template uses OAuth2 based authentication and it's easy to change that. FastAPI docs has a comprehensive list of the available [authentication options](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/) and instructions on how to use them.

* During deployment, you may need to change the host name and port number. To do so, just change the values of `HOST` and `PORT` variables under the `environment` section in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
