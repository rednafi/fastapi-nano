## Description

This is a minimalistic and extensible [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) template that incorporates factory pattern architecture with [divisional folder structure](https://exploreflask.com/en/latest/blueprints.html#divisional). It's suitable for developing small to medium sized API oriented micro-services. The architecture is similar to what you'd get with Flask's [Blueprint](https://exploreflask.com/en/latest/blueprints.html).

## Features

* It uses [FastAPI]() framework for API development. FastAPI is a modern, highly performant, web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+.

* The APIs are served with [Uvicorn]() server. Uvicorn is a lightning-fast "ASGI" server. It runs asynchronous Python web code in a single process.

* [Gunicorn]() is used here to manage Uvicorn and run multiple of these concurrent processes. That way, you get the best of concurrency and parallelism.

* Password based http basic authentication to secure the endpoints.

* [CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cors/) enabled.

* Flask inspired divisional folder structure better decoupling and encapsulation. This is suitable for small to medium backend development.

* Dockerized using [uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi-docker]( https://github.com/tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi-docker
). This image will set a sensible configuration based on the server it is running on (the amount of CPU cores available) without making sacrifices.

    It has sensible defaults, but you can configure it with environment variables or override the configuration files.

└── README.md                 # meta
```

In the above structure, `api_a` and `api_b` are the main packages where the code of the APIs live and they are exposed by the endpoints defined in the `routes` folder. Here, `api_a` and `api_b` are dummy APIs that take an integer and return two random integers between zero and the input value.

The following snippets show the logic behind the dummy APIs (`api_b` looks identical to `api_a`):

```python
# app/api_a/submod.py

# This a dummy module
# This gets called in the module_main.py file

import random


def random_dict(num: int) -> dict:
    num = int(num)
    d = {
        "seed": num,
        "random_first": random.randint(0, num),
        "random_second": random.randint(0, num),
    }
    return d

```

```python
# app/api_a/mainmod.py

from app.api_a.submod import random_dict


def func_main(num: int) -> dict:
    d = random_dict(num)
    return d
```

So hitting the API with a random integer will give you a response like the following:

```json
{
  "seed": 34,
  "random_first": 27,
  "random_second": 20
}
```


## Quickstart

### Running the Containers

* Clone the repository.

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:rednafi/fastapi-nano.git
    ```

* Go to the root folder and run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

### Hitting the APIs

* To play around with the APIs, go to the following link on your browser:

    ```
    http://localhost:5000/docs
    ```

    This will take you to an UI like below:

* Press the `authorize` button on the right and add username and password. The APIs use basic password based authentication. In this case, the username and password is `rednafi` and `ubuntu` respectively.

* Then select any of the APIs and put an integer in the number box and click the `execute` button.

* Hitting the API should give a json response with random integers.

    ![Screenshot from 2020-05-29 02-42-34](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30027932/83191591-1a604e80-a156-11ea-930f-4a805d1f631c.png)

* Also, notice the `curl` section in the above screen shot. You can directly use the highlighted curl command in your terminal.

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api-a/34" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Basic cmVkbmFmaTp1YnVudHU="
    ```

    This should show a response like this:

    ```json
    {"seed":34,"random_first":13,"random_second":27}
    ```

* To test the `GET` APIs with Python, you can use a http client library like [httpx]():

    ```python
    import httpx

    headers = {
        "accept": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Basic cmVkbmFmaTp1YnVudHU=",
    }

    with httpx.Client() as client:
        response = client.get("http://localhost:5000/api-a/34", headers=headers)
        print(response.json())
    ```
