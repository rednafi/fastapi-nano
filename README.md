## Description

This is a minimalistic and extensible [FastAPI][fastapi] template that incorporates
divisional pattern architecture with [divisional folder structure][divisional_pattern]. It's
suitable for developing small to medium sized API oriented micro-services. The architecture
is similar to what you'd get with Flask's [Blueprint][blueprint].

## Features

-   It uses [FastAPI][fastapi] framework for API development. FastAPI is a modern, highly
    performant, web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+.

-   The APIs are served with [Gunicorn](gunicorn) server with multiple [Uvicorn][uvicorn]
    workers. Uvicorn is a lightning-fast "ASGI" server. It runs asynchronous Python web code
    in a single process.

-   Simple reverse-proxying with [Caddy][caddy].

-   OAuth2 (with hashed password and Bearer with JWT) based authentication

-   [CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)][cors] enabled.

-   Flask inspired divisional folder structure for better decoupling and encapsulation. This
    is suitable for small to medium backend development.

-   Dockerized using **python:3.13-slim-bookworm** and optimized for size and functionality.
    Dockerfile for Python 3.11, 3.10, and 3.9 can also be found in the `dockerfiles`
    directory.

## Quickstart

### Run the app in containers

-   Clone the repo and navigate to the root folder.

-   To run the app using Docker, make sure you've got [Docker][docker] installed on your
    system. From the project's root directory, run:

        ```sh
        docker compose up -d
        ```

### Or, run the app locally

If you want to run the app locally, without using Docker, then:

-   Clone the repo and navigate to the root folder.

-   Create a virtual environment. Here I'm using Python's built-in venv in a Unix system.
    Run:

    ```sh
    python3.12 -m venv .venv
    ```

-   Activate the environment. Run:

    ```sh
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

-   Go to the folder created by cookie-cutter (default is **fastapi-nano**).

-   Install the dependencies. Run:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

-   Start the app. Run:

    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --port 5002 --reload
    ```

### Check the APIs

-   To play around with the APIs, go to the following link on your browser:

    ```
    http://localhost:5002/docs
    ```

    This will take you to an UI like below:

    ![Screenshot from 2020-06-21 22-15-18][screenshot_1]

-   Press the `authorize` button on the right and add _username_ and _password_. The APIs
    use OAuth2 (with hashed password and Bearer with JWT) based authentication. In this
    case, the username and password is `ubuntu` and `debian` respectively.

    ![Screenshot from 2020-06-21 22-18-25][screenshot_2]

    Clicking the `authorize` button will bring up a screen like this:

    ![Screenshot from 2020-06-21 22-18-59][screenshot_3]

-   Then select any of the `api_a` or `api_b` APIs and put an integer in the number box and
    click the `authorize` button.

    ![Screenshot from 2020-06-21 22-31-19][screenshot_4]

-   Hitting the API should give a json response with random integers.

    ![Screenshot from 2020-06-21 22-32-28][screenshot_5]

-   Also, notice the `curl` section in the above screen shot. You can directly use the
    highlighted curl command in your terminal. Make sure you've got `jq` installed in your
    system.

    ```sh
    curl -X GET "http://localhost:5002/api_a/22" \
            -H "accept: application/json" \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer $(curl -X POST "http://localhost:5002/token" \
                            -H "accept: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
                            -d "username=ubuntu&password=debian" | jq -r ".access_token")"
    ```

    This should show a response like this:

    ```json
    {
        "seed": 22,
        "random_first": 5,
        "random_second": 13
    }
    ```

-   To test the `GET` APIs with Python, you can use a http client library like
    [httpx][httpx]:

    ```python
    import httpx

    with httpx.Client() as client:

        # Collect the API token.
        r = client.post(
            "http://localhost:5002/token",
            headers={"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"},
            data={"username": "ubuntu", "password": "debian"},
        )
        token = r.json()["access_token"]

        # Use the token value to hit the API.
        r = client.get(
            "http://localhost:5002/api_a/22",
            headers={"Accept": "application/json", "Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"},
        )
        print(r.json())
    ```

└── requirements.txt              # pinned app dependencies
```

In the above structure, `api_a` and `api_b` are the main packages where the code of the APIs
live and they are exposed by the endpoints defined in the `routes` folder. Here, `api_a` and
`api_b` have identical logic. Basically these are dummy APIs that take an integer as input
and return two random integers between zero and the input value. The purpose of including
two identical APIs in the template is to demonstrate how you can decouple the logics of
multiple APIs and then assemble their endpoints in the routes directory. The following
snippets show the logic behind the dummy APIs.

This is a dummy submodule that houses a function called `random_gen` which generates a
dictionary of random integers.

```python
# This a dummy module
# This gets called in the module_main.py file
from __future__ import annotations
import random


def rand_gen(num: int) -> dict[str, int]:
    num = int(num)
    d = {
        "seed": num,
        "random_first": random.randint(0, num),
        "random_second": random.randint(0, num),
    }
    return d
```

The `main_func` in the primary module calls the `rand_gen` function from the submodule.

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from app.api_a.submod import rand_gen


def main_func(num: int) -> dict[str, int]:
    d = rand_gen(num)
    return d
```

The endpoint is exposed like this:

```python
# app/routes/views.py
from __future__ import annotations
#... codes regarding authentication ...

# endpoint for api_a (api_b looks identical)
@router.get("/api_a/{num}", tags=["api_a"])
async def view_a(num: int, auth: Depends =Depends(get_current_user)) -> dict[str, int]:
    return main_func_a(num)
```

So hitting the API with a random integer will give you a response like the following:

```json
{
  "seed": 22,
  "random_first": 27,
  "random_second": 20
}
```

## Further modifications

-   You can put your own API logics in the shape of `api_a` and `api_b` packages. You'll
    have to add additional directories like `api_a` and `api_b` if you need more APIs.

-   Then expose the APIs in the `routes/views.py` file. You may choose to create multiple
    `views` files to organize your endpoints.

-   This template uses OAuth2 based authentication and it's easy to change that. FastAPI
    docs has a comprehensive list of the available [authentication][fastapi_security]
    options and instructions on how to use them.

-   You can change the application port in the `.env` file.

-   During prod deployment, you might need to fiddle with the reverse-proxy rules in the
    Caddyfile.
